Deepfake AI to quantum ransomware: Top cybersecurity threats of 2025
As we enter New Year 2025, one can’t help but feel some trepidation, thanks largely to an ever-shifting cybersecurity landscape poised for unprecedented challenges. The rapid evolution of technologies such AI and smart IoT has not only driven innovation but also expanded the attack vectors for cybercriminals. From AI-enhanced ransomware to the looming threats posed by quantum computing, experts warn organisations and individuals alike to brace themselves for a new era of sophisticated cyberattacks. 
Here we try to delve into the top cybersecurity threats anticipated in 2025, exploring how these emerging dangers could impact various sectors and what measures can be taken to mitigate them.
Ransomware has evolved significantly through 2024, adopting more sophisticated and multifaceted tactics. Cybercriminals have increasingly leveraged AI to enhance the speed and precision of their attacks, enabling rapid propagation across networks and complicating early detection efforts. For instance, the Ymir ransomware, identified in November 2024, exploits memory management to evade detection, targeting corporate networks with advanced techniques.
The rise of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) models has democratised access to advanced ransomware tools, allowing even less experienced actors to launch sophisticated attacks – a notable example is the attack on Newpark Resources, a major oilfield supplier, in November 2024, which disrupted critical systems and highlighted the accessibility of ransomware tools to a broader range of cybercriminals. 
The adoption of double and triple extortion tactics has become more prevalent. In October 2024, the University of Paris-Saclay experienced such an attack, where the RansomHouse group threatened to disclose 1 terabyte of sensitive data, including personal documents, unless a ransom was paid. 
Furthermore, as quantum computing advances, ransomware groups may begin employing quantum-proof encryption techniques, making it nearly impossible for victims to decrypt their data without paying the ransom. Critical infrastructure sectors, such as energy, water, and healthcare, have become prime targets, with attackers seeking maximum impact and leverage by disrupting essential services. By all indications the expanse of ransomware will continue to grow through 2025 and beyond, as much as we hate to say it.
Just like ransomware, deepfakes are projected to become more pervasive and sophisticated in 2025, posing significant challenges across various sectors, according to various cybersecurity reports. The increasing accessibility of AI tools enables malicious actors to create highly convincing fake videos and audio, facilitating the easy spread of misinformation, fraud, and identity theft. For example, in the US Presidential Election 2024, deepfake technology was used to spread misinformation by impersonating political figures, leading to incidents like the AI-generated robocalls in New Hampshire that discouraged voting by mimicking President Joe Biden’s voice.

Not just limited to impersonating popular figures, the financial sector is also increasingly at risk, with deepfakes being employed to bypass identity verification processes. A report from Entrust Cybersecurity Institute revealed that in 2024, a deepfake attack occurred every five minutes, highlighting the frequency and effectiveness of such tactics. Moreover, the proliferation of deepfake pornography has raised serious ethical and legal concerns. In South Korea, a surge in AI-generated explicit images led to legislative action criminalising the possession and distribution of non-consensual deepfake content. As deepfake technology continues to advance, the line between reality and fabrication blurs, necessitating robust detection mechanisms and regulatory frameworks to mitigate the associated risks.
The automotive industry is experiencing a rapid evolution in cyber threats, with projections indicating significant developments through 2025 and beyond. By 2025, there are expected to be over 400 million connected cars in operation, up from 237 million in 2021, according to a Statista report. As vehicles become increasingly connected and autonomous, they are more susceptible to cyberattacks targeting their complex electronic systems. A report by Research and Markets highlights that effective automotive cybersecurity now requires cross-industry collaboration to address threats both within the vehicle and its external networks, including infrastructure. 
The integration of AI and machine learning into vehicular systems introduces new vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals will no doubt exploit these technologies to manipulate vehicle behaviour or access sensitive data. Trend Micro’s subsidiary, VicOne, emphasises that as vehicles progress toward software-defined models, the attack surface expands, necessitating robust cybersecurity measures. 
The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) and their associated infrastructure, such as charging stations, presents additional challenges. In India and around the world, there’s an increased need for securing clean energy infrastructure from potential cyberattacks, recognising the critical need to protect EVs and their charging networks. Furthermore, concerns about foreign-manufactured vehicles have emerged. According to reports, US officials have warned of potential dangers associated with Chinese technology in cars, citing risks of espionage and sabotage.
Social media, once a platform for connection, is now a breeding ground for cybercrime. The integration of GenAI with social media has amplified these threats, making it easier for criminals to launch highly targeted and sophisticated attacks, according to Check Point Software Technologies Ltd – an American-Israeli cybersecurity solution provider.
They predict that throughout 2025 and beyond, AI-powered tools will enable criminals to mimic the behaviour, appearance, and voice of individuals, creating realistic impersonations. This is particularly dangerous on professional networks like LinkedIn, where the expectation of legitimate connections makes it easy for bad actors to infiltrate.
Criminals are increasingly using social engineering tactics, employing AI to craft convincing impersonations and launch large-scale attacks. AI-driven bots and deepfakes can impersonate high-profile individuals, blurring the lines between reality and deception. The potential for these attacks to compromise corporate security and personal data is significant.
Quantum computing is poised to revolutionise cybersecurity, introducing both unprecedented capabilities and significant threats. By 2025, advancements in quantum technology are expected to challenge traditional cryptographic defences, particularly public-key algorithms like RSA and ECC, which could be rendered vulnerable to quantum attacks. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been proactive in addressing these concerns, releasing post-quantum cryptography standards in 2024. However, the transition to these new standards is anticipated to be gradual, with larger enterprises, especially in finance, needing to begin planning for this quantum shift to protect sensitive data. 
The concept of “harvest now, decrypt later” underscores the urgency of adopting quantum-resistant encryption. Adversaries may collect encrypted data now, anticipating future quantum capabilities to decrypt it, compromising long-term data security. In response, organisations are expected to invest in quantum-safe encryption methods and develop comprehensive migration strategies to safeguard critical information. This proactive approach is essential to mitigate the looming quantum threat and ensure the integrity of digital communications in the quantum era. 
The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is anticipated to significantly expand the cyber threat landscape through 2025 and beyond. As IoT adoption accelerates, the number of connected devices is projected to reach 21.5 billion by 2025, substantially increasing potential attack surfaces. Many IoT devices lack robust security measures, making them susceptible to exploitation. Cybercriminals are expected to target these vulnerabilities to launch large-scale Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, infiltrate networks, and exfiltrate sensitive data. 
The integration of IoT in critical infrastructure sectors, such as healthcare, energy, and transportation, introduces additional risks. Compromises in these areas could lead to severe disruptions and safety hazards. For instance, vulnerabilities in medical IoT devices may jeopardise patient safety, while attacks on smart grids could disrupt power supplies. To mitigate these evolving threats, organisations must implement comprehensive security strategies, including device hardening, secure communication protocols, and continuous monitoring. Regulatory bodies are also expected to enforce stricter cybersecurity standards for IoT devices to foster a more secure ecosystem. To cut a long story short, the rapid expansion of IoT presents significant cybersecurity challenges that necessitate proactive measures to safeguard against emerging threats.
