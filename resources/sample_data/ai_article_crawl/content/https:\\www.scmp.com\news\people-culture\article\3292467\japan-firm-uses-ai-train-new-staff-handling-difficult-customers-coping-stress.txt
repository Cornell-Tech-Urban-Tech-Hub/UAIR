Japan firm uses AI to train new staff in handling difficult customers, coping with stress
Technology offers rookie customer service staff chance to hone pacification skills on non-humans before being posted to frontline
A company in Japan has turned to artificial intelligence (AI) technology to train staff how to deal with demanding customers.
The move is aimed at boosting the adaptability of staff and enhancing their ability to cope with stress.
Constant exposure to high-pressure customer interactions has left many employees in the telephone service industry overworked, resulting in persistent labour shortages.
The technology company Interactive-Solutions has recently created iRolePlay, a ChatGPT-powered AI tool that trains customer service staff using simulated conversations.
ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI and launched in 2022, enables lifelike dialogue and smart text responses.
Tokyo Television reported that iRolePlay can simulate a range of customer personalities to provide training for customer service personnel.
