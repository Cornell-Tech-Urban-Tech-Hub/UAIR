[{"about_computing_score": 6, "about_computing_explanation": "The article mentions AR glasses, which is a computing concept. However, the discussion is relatively surface-level, and the focus is shared with non-technological topics, such as politics and Trump's executive orders. The article provides some depth in discussing the growing popularity of AR glasses, but other themes, like politics and business, still play a notable role."}]
