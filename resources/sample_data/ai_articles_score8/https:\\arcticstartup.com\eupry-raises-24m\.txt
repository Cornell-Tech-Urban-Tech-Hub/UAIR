Eupry is a compliance technology company that simplifies temperature and humidity monitoring, calibration, and mapping for highly regulated industries such as pharmaceuticals, biotech, and logistics. Combining innovative hardware and a centralized cloud-based system, Eupry delivers a seamless, GxP-compliant digital solution that ensures accurate and efficient temperature compliance across facilities.
Founded through a collaboration between UNICEF and the Technical University of Denmark, Eupry leverages automation to eliminate gaps, reduce manual effort, and streamline regulatory adherence in industries where precision is critical. Inspired by the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid’s decentralized yet adaptive nervous system, Eupry’s independent data loggers and cloud platform work in harmony, providing reliable and scalable compliance solutions to global clients.
Eupry’s innovative hardware and software solutions integrate validation, monitoring, and calibration into a unified system, transforming compliance processes for highly regulated industries like pharmaceuticals, biotech, and logistics. By replacing manual, risk-prone workflows with efficient digital tools, Eupry enables these sectors to overcome longstanding challenges in compliance and operational efficiency.
A recent $24 million funding round, led by Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker with support from Ugly Duckling Ventures, EIFO, and Sagitta, underscores the global demand for Eupry’s solutions and the confidence investors have in the company’s vision. This investment not only fuels product development but also affirms Eupry’s commitment to modernizing compliance in industries traditionally resistant to digitalization.
Since its inception, Eupry has prioritized innovation over rapid expansion, resulting in advancements like its patented calibration technology, which reduces process times by up to 80%. Despite progress in digitization, regulated industries remain underserved, with many major companies still struggling to find effective solutions.
Eupry’s focus on reliability, innovation, and customer-centric development continues to position the company as a leader in addressing these gaps. The new funding will support product expansion and team growth, ensuring that Eupry can meet evolving industry needs and drive meaningful change in compliance practices.
