Brett Galvin, Apple's Corporate Communications and Public Relations for Southeast Asia, briefly acknowledged the presence of reporters, stating, “We don't have time.”
He was accompanied by Nick Amman, Apple's Vice President of Global Policy. Based on the Investment Coordinating Board’s (BKPM) Instagram post, @bpkm_id, Nick Amman had previously met with Minister of Investment/Head of BKPM Rosan Roeslani in November 2024.
Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita had previously confirmed that negotiations with Apple's top executives were scheduled for January 7 or 8, 2025. He emphasized that these negotiations would be challenging. “Negotiations will not be easy. Apple will prioritize their own interests, which we assume are based on profit margins,” said Agus on Friday, January 3, 2025.
Minister Agus stressed that the Indonesian government would uphold principles of fairness and equity in evaluating Apple's investment proposals. These principles include considering Apple's investment activities in other countries, investments made by other mobile phone manufacturers in Indonesia, the potential for increased value and income for Indonesia, and the creation of local employment opportunities.
These negotiations follow a period of stalled investment discussions between Apple and the Indonesian government. Apple initially proposed a US$100 million investment to comply with the government's Domestic Component Level (TKDN) requirements. However, Minister of Investment Rosan Roeslani urged Apple to increase its commitment to US$1 billion or Rp16.14 trillion (exchange rate of Rp16,146.25 per US dollar).
