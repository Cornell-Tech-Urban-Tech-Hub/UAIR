   BEIJING, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- China's Shenzhou-19 crew aboard the orbiting Tiangong space station sent their New Year greetings in a video on Tuesday, anticipating more breakthroughs in the country's manned space program in 2025.
   "Today is the last day of 2024, and I hope everyone joins me in being full of energy, forging ahead and sprinting into 2025," said Cai Xuzhe, commander of the Shenzhou-19 mission, while he was on a treadmill.
   After introducing a recent experiment related to the effects of force on bones and muscles during exercise, astronaut Song Lingdong expressed optimism about the space laboratory's many potential achievements in the coming year. He wished everyone a bountiful harvest and endless good fortune in 2025.

Wang explained that, with future upgrades, it would be able to perform tasks such as in-module inspections, inventory management and product status monitoring.
