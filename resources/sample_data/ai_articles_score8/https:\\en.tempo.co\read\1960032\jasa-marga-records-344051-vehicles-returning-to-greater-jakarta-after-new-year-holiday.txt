The 300,000 vehicles were the cumulative number of traffic flows from four main toll gates, namely Cikupa (from Merak), Ciawi (from Puncak), Cikampek Utama (from Trans Java), and Kalihurip Utama (from Bandung).
Jasa Marga Corporate Communication and Community Development Group Head Lisye Octaviana said that the total volume of traffic returning to the Jabotabek area increased by 30.83 percent compared to the normal traffic of 262,970 vehicles.
The traffic returning to Jabotabek was mostly from three directions, namely the east (Trans Java and Bandung) with 165,658 vehicles or 48.1 percent, the west (Merak) with 96,210 vehicles (28.0 percent), and the south (Puncak) with 82,183 vehicles (23.9 percent).
Jasa Marga also conducted a 10 percent toll discount promotion on the Trans Java Toll Road on Friday, January 3, 2025, for the New Year 2025 return trip from Semarang to Jakarta (from the Kalikangkung Toll Gate to the Cikampek Utama Toll Gate).
The company also appeals to toll road users to plan for the 2025 New Year's holiday trip, for example, by using the Travoy application.
In addition, drivers are advised to always be in top condition, use time wisely to rest, ensure sufficient fuel and electronic money card balances, and obey signs and instructions from officers in the field.
