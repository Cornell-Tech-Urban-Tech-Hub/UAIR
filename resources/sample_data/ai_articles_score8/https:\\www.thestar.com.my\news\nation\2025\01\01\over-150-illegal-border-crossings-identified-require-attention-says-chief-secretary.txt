PASIR MAS: A total of 169 illegal crossings along the Malaysia-Thailand border have been identified as requiring attention, says Chief Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Shamsul Azri Abu Bakar.
He said that as a result, the government is targeting to reduce and eventually close these illegal crossings or entry points.
"Border control measures need to be enhanced, and it is important to reduce cross-border crimes and smuggling activities.
"I urge that the installation of CCTVs at the countryâ€™s entry points be expedited, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology be implemented, as recommended by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim," he said.
He spoke to reporters during the launch of the Malaysian Border Control and Protection Agency pilot operation at the Immigration, Customs, Quarantine and Security (ICQS) Complex in Rantau Panjang here on Wednesday (Jan 1).
More to come.

[{"about_computing_score": 8, "about_computing_explanation": "The article mentions the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in border control measures, which is a significant role in the discussion. However, the article's main focus is on border control and illegal crossings, rather than AI itself. The discussion lacks depth in terms of technical aspects of AI, but it does provide some insight into its potential applications in this context."}]
