President Joe Biden ordered the flag to be lowered to half-staff for 30 days after Carter's death on Dec. 29, 2024. The lowering of the flag to half-staff is a tradition to honor the passing of a U.S. president.
Donald Trump took issue with the flag remaining at its mourning position during his inauguration in a post on Truth Social on Friday, Jan. 3, 2025. "The Democrats are very excited about the possibility that the magnificent American Flag will be flown 'at half-staff' at my Inauguration," Trump said, according to Reuters.
He used a term often used for the lowered position when the flag is on a ship. "They think it's great and are very happy about it because, in reality, they don't love our Country, they only care about themselves," Trump said.
White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said the White House had no plans to reconsider the decision.
