[{"about_computing_score": 8, "about_computing_explanation": "The article is primarily related to computing, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI), as it mentions 'M42 leading AI revolution in healthcare' and 'Meta to spend up to $65 billion this year to power AI goals'. These statements indicate a significant focus on AI, with some depth in discussion, as it highlights the financial investment and potential impact on the healthcare sector. However, other non-technological topics are also present, such as sports and politics, which slightly reduces the centrality of AI in the article."}]
