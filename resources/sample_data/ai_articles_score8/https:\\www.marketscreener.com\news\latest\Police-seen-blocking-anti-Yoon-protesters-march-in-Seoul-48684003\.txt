STORY: :: Protesters against impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol are met with heavy police resistance

              :: Seoul, South Korea

              :: January 4, 2025

              In footage captured from a building, police could be seen in formation surrounding and blocking protesters during their march towards Yoon's official residence. 

              South Korean investigators again asked the country's acting president on Saturday to order the presidential security service to comply with an arrest warrant for Yoon, a day after presidential guards and military troops prevented authorities from arresting the impeached president in a tense six-hour stand-off inside Yoon's compound in the heart of Seoul.

              Yoon is under criminal investigation for insurrection over his December 3 martial law bid that stunned South Korea and led to the first arrest warrant to be issued for a sitting president.
