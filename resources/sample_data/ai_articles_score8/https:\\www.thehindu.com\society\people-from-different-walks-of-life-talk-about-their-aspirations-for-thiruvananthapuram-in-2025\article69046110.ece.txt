The New Year has dawned. As Thiruvananthapuram continues to grow by leaps and bounds, a few residents of the city talk about their hopes for the city’s future, touching upon subjects such as infrastructure improvement, environment conservation and cultural development.

With the Smart City project on, overhead lines are being laid underground in some stretches of the city. If that is implemented everywhere we will get a cityscape free of those lines and cables, which is also a photographer’s dream. Meanwhile, I don’t wish to see any more of those unused constructions, like the foot overbridges at East Fort and Pattom.  I hope the authorities find a solution for the unscientific traffic arrangement along the NH bypass, especially at the accident-prone Thiruvallam stretch. We also need more parking guards and stringent action against unauthorised parking. The city’s circular buses have changed the face of public transport; that can be augmented by proper display of the bus routes at bus stands. On the cultural front, I want Manaveeyam Veedhi to be back as a cultural corridor. It was a preposterous move to convert that small stretch into a nightlife destination. The plan to set up a permanent theatre complex to host the prestigious International Film Festival of Kerala remains on paper and I wish to hear the last word on that.

We need more open mics, musical gatherings and concerts to support independent music and musicians. This wish comes from the current scenario of streaming services extorting artists all over the world and the whole AI wave where we are struggling to value art. These avenues will help new as well as existing creators to feel connected with the audience.

I want Thiruvananthapuram to evolve into a globally recognised destination through strategic city branding — it needs a unique visual identity, that fuses tradition and innovation. The city has immense potential to host world-class cultural and heritage events, like the Biennale, which would draw global attention. Also, as an emerging IT hub and home to Technopark, the city should host more tech festivals like Huddle Global, focussing on innovations, hackathons, and exhibitions that can position the city as a technology powerhouse. Initiatives like these would enhance the city’s vibrancy and global identity, attract investments, drive development, and bring more business opportunities. We need a blend of culture and technology to establish Thiruvananthapuram as a thriving hub for tourism, commerce and creativity.

Waste and sewer management has been a serious issue. The death of a sanitation worker, last year, has once again highlighted the urgent need for a more efficient and humane approach to solve this problem. I wish we adopt robotics and AI for the same thereby creating a cleaner, safer and humane scenario, which we successfully did with the Bandicoot robot. Another big concern according to me has been people’s safety, especially of women and children. This can be achieved by  leveraging technology, just as we successfully did with traffic management. By installing and integrating AI-enabled cameras and stringent laws, Thiruvananthapuram can be one of the safest cities.

We need to come up with humane and effective ways to tackle the stray dog menace in the city. Awareness needs to be given on safe and healthy cohabitation. Also, having been working in a forum that focus on communication and personality development I want to see a sense of accountability, independence and responsibility in children by encouraging more internship and volunteering works at an early age through assured safe working environments. This can be done especially if colleges give weightage to volunteering work and internships during admissions. To put the aspects together, children can be involved in volunteering in care homes, animal shelters, and feeding and taking care of friendly strays, thereby teaching them compassion.

Thiruvananthapuram has seen a tremendous increase in the number of food outlets (standalone, regional and international brands) over the last five years. Although that is commendable, I want to see them having sustainable growth thereby surviving for a longer time. This requires a multi-pronged approach — proper R&D before opening the venture, well-trained staff, and proper feedback from influencers and food bloggers, highlighting the best through their channels or platforms. The authorities (food safety, health etc) should also give regular assessments of the eateries and provide proper training to the players in the field. Meanwhile, I am manifesting a Thiruvananthapuram with various local and international cuisines and concepts thriving, while maintaining the essence of regional tastes.

As a terrarium artist, it is an interesting time to be in Thiruvananthapuram where a lot of small businesses and artists are getting noticed, thanks to social media. With generative AI and digital art becoming more accessible and easily available, handcrafted art such as terrariums or paludariums is getting more value. However, I look forward to events that showcase these lesser-known arts and crafts. While galleries showcase paintings and sculptures, having a space to exhibit such works of art would be ideal for an artist like me to grow.

It is high time protecting the city’s green cover became our priority. It is our responsibility as well as our need. Things are not looking good due to a steady decline in the number of trees and the general health of the flora. Strict laws to control the felling of trees have to be in place. Everyone should be made accountable because most people don’t care for the trees. Unfortunately, the young generation is passive about this; that has to change. A wish for 2025 would be to spread the word among school children. Tree auditing has to be done, so that people know what we have and how much we have lost. While reports indicate that the city’s air quality is currently good, maintaining it requires constant effort. Protecting our environment and green cover is not optional; it is essential for ensuring the future generation’s well-being and sustainability.
