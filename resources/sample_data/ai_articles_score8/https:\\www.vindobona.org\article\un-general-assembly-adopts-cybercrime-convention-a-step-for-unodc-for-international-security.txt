      UN General Assembly Adopts Cybercrime Convention: A Step for UNODC for International Security    
With the rapid advancement of technology, new forms of crime have emerged that take advantage of artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and other digital innovations. Cybercrime ranges from identity theft and financial fraud to human trafficking, drug smuggling, and serious attacks on critical infrastructure.
Cyberattacks are increasing compared to previous years, with damage to the global economy estimated at over one trillion US dollars. These crimes affect not only companies and governments but also individuals who fall victim to online fraud, data theft, or cyberbullying.
The new convention
The UN Convention against Cybercrime provides a comprehensive framework for preventing, combating, and investigating cybercrime. It calls on member states to adopt national legislation to address cybercrime more effectively. It also facilitates the exchange of electronic evidence across borders and establishes mechanisms for technical assistance and capacity building. Important aspects include the creation of investigative tools that are compatible with modern technologies and the establishment of standards for data protection and respect for human rights.
Cybersecurity and international responses
A senior US government official explained that the US opted for the treaty to influence its implementation and ensure that it is applied in accordance with human rights. The Biden administration plans to develop a detailed program to minimize implementation risks and ensure that other states do not abuse the provisions.
Despite international support for the Convention, there is considerable opposition from human rights groups and some US senators. A group of Democratic senators led by Ron Wyden called on the Biden administration to reject the treaty. Their main concerns are the potential threat to digital rights and the possibility that authoritarian regimes could use the treaty's provisions to repress dissent. To address these concerns, the US government plans to work with NGOs to create mechanisms to prevent abuse.
The importance of international cooperation
Ghada Waly, Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), emphasized in her statement that cybercrime not only undermines economies but also shakes trust in digital infrastructures and institutions. “The need for cooperation and action has never been greater,” she said. The need for cooperation is particularly evident in cross-border cyberattacks, which often start in one country and cause damage in another.
Challenges and criticism
Although the agreement is widely supported, there are also critics. Some experts warn that certain provisions of the agreement could potentially be misused to restrict freedom of expression or persecute political dissidents. There are also concerns about the different capacities of states to implement the agreement. Developed countries often have more resources for cyber defense than developing countries, which could lead to inequalities. These disparities could be mitigated through targeted support and technical cooperation, but this requires long-term political will.
The role of the UNODC
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime will play a central role in the implementation of the Convention. It plans to offer comprehensive training programs for member states, provide technical assistance, and coordinate the international exchange of information. In a press conference, Waly emphasized that the UNODC has been successful in similar global initiatives in the past, such as the fight against human trafficking and drug smuggling. “By securing digital spaces, we can create a safer world for everyone,” she emphasized.
Next steps
The Convention will be opened for signature at a ceremony in Hanoi, Vietnam, in spring 2025. It will enter into force 90 days after ratification by the 40th signatory state. The international community hopes that the agreement will lay the foundation for a new era of cyber security while preserving the digital space as an engine for social and economic development. Several countries, including the USA, China, and Germany, have already signaled their willingness to ratify the agreement quickly. Non-governmental organizations and tech companies such as Microsoft and Google are also showing interest in contributing to its successful implementation through partnerships.
Connection with the SDGs
The impact of cybercrime goes far beyond economic losses. It also threatens the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, cybercrime impedes access to quality education (SDG 4) by hacking online learning platforms. It also undermines SDG 16, which focuses on peace, justice, and strong institutions. The new convention could help address these challenges and support the implementation of the SDGs.
The adoption of the UN Convention against Cybercrime is a crucial step at a time when cybercrime threats are becoming increasingly complex and global. By strengthening international cooperation and providing a clear legal framework, this agreement could help restore trust in digital technologies and create a safer digital future. Implementation and continuous adaptation will be crucial to effectively address the challenges of the digital age. Only through coordinated action can governments, businesses, and civil society work together to create a robust and resilient digital world.
