[{"about_computing_score": 8, "about_computing_explanation": "The article mentions 'AI' in the context of 'With help of AI, many things have become easy here': Union Minister Khadse praises UP govt efforts in Mahakumbh, indicating that AI is a significant theme. However, the discussion is relatively surface-level, and other themes (such as politics and governance) also play a notable role. The article does provide some depth in exploring the implications of AI, but it is not the exclusive focus."}]
