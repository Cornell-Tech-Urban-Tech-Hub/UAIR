Air India set to transform into world-class airline, says Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran
“My commitment is to take every effort to make Air India an absolute top-class airline in the world,” said Chandrasekaran, highlighting the group’s focus on upgrading flight hardware, enhancing customer experience, and leveraging advanced technology.
Tata Group acquired Air India in 2022 for Rs 18,000 crore, marking the airline’s return to its original founders after decades of government ownership.
To bolster Air India’s transformation, the company has placed orders for 470 new aircraft—250 from Airbus and 220 from Boeing. Chandrasekaran, in a lighter vein, appealed to the audience to encourage Boeing and Airbus to expedite deliveries.
India is preparing to celebrate its 76th Republic Day on January 26, 2025, with a grand parade in New Delhi. The event will showcase the country’s military power, cultural heritage, and progress under the theme of ‘Swarnim Bharat: Virasat aur Vikas.’ This year is especially significant as it marks the 75th anniversary of India’s Constitution.
