Not allow their respective social media handles to publish and circulate deepfake audios/videos which violate the provisions of extant rules and regulations.  
Whenever such deepfake audios/videos come to the notice of political parties, they shall immediately take down the post but a maximum within 3 hours and also identify and warn the responsible person within the party.   
The monkey on the back
Deepfake technology has long troubled celebrities. Recently, journalist Rajat Sharma moved the Delhi High Court against AI-generated content misusing his likeness to sell medicines and other products. The court ordered the removal of such content.
In similar cases, Indian courts have issued injunctions protecting the personality rights of celebrities like Karan Johar, Amitabh Bachchan, and Anil Kapoor, prohibiting the unauthorised use of their voice, image, and other attributes.
When political parties openly use deepfake videos featuring ministers and actors from popular shows, one can’t help but question: Is everything truly fair in love and war? What do you think?
