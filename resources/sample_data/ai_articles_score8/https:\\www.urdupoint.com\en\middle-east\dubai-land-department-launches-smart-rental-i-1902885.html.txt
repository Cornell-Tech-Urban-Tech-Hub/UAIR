These mentions are significant, and the discussion is not shallow. However, the article does not exclusively focus on AI, as it covers various other topics, including sports, festivals, and real estate projects. The centrality of AI to the article's main theme is high, but the depth of discussion is moderate, as the article does not delve into technical or analytical aspects of AI."}]
